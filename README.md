Due to increasing complexity in modern system and critical infrastructure, there is a need for high assurance system. These systems require robust security against potential malfunctions or malicious attacks. Inorder to overcome this problem, seL4 microkernel can be used. It has a microkernel architecture hence there is a minimized attack surface. Threrfore it is used in various safety critical fields like aerospace, defense and military where safety is given high priority. In our project, we have used QEMU an emulator, to emulate the process of seL4 booting. QEMU is a versatile tool that provides both emulation and virtualization capabilities. It allows users to run software designed for one architecture on another and is commonly used in development, testing, and research. QEMU can emulate different types of hardware, including CPUs, memory, storage devices, network interfaces, and more. It can simulate various architectures like x86, ARM, PowerPC, RISC-V, SPARC, and others. powerful tool for running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine. The listed dependencies are crucial for setting up a development environment to build and run seL4-based projects. These include tools for compiling code (like GCC, CMake, and Ninja), emulating different hardware architectures (via QEMU), and managing Python and Haskell dependencies required by seL4 and CAmkES projects. The Python script automates the process of launching the seL4 microkernel in a QEMU-emulated environment. The dependencies ensure that the necessary tools and libraries are available for cross-compiling the kernel and running it in a virtualized environment, with the task manager showing CPU usage as evidence of the kernel's execution.
